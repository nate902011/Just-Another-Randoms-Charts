Put your rating sprites in here!

To ensure no issues, the following sprites must be in this folder:
perfect.png
sick.png
good.png
bad.png
shit.png
All pngs from num0.png to num9.png

You can also add optional 'hitStrings', 'fcStrings' and 'judgeCountStrings' text files to customize your rating type even further!

You will need the following amount of lines for each text file:
fcStrings: 10 lines
hitStrings: 6 lines
judgeCountStrings: 6 lines

There are example versions of these files included in here if you need help!
