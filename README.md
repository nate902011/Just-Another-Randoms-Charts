// HOUSE //

Bop Boop Bep!

Hm? Oh, hey! I know you! Aren't you the guy that defeated Dearest on TV a few months back?

Yeah!

Bapity boop bep!

Oh, and you're challenging me to a singing battle?

Well... I warn you, I've won quite a few back in the day!

Beeeep!

Let's start with a simple one!



// INSANITY //


...

Bap bep?

Ah! Sorry, was just thinking...

Anyway, ready for the next song?

Beep Baaaaaap!

Alright!


// INSANITY END //


Oh... oh no...

Bep?


// POLYGONIZED //


WHAT

NO NO NO I THOUGHT

I THOUGHT

WHY IS IT GETTING WORSE

MY KIDS THEYRE STILL IN THE HOUSE

B-beep..?



// BLOCKED //


Well this is the place Dave invited us to.

I like the grass!

Yeah!

I do wonder why he picked this spot though. Did he want us to meet someone?

Who goes there??

Beep?

Wait a minute... Are you two trying to steal my corn?

Bo. Beep Skidee Bop-

I GONNA BLOCK YOU OUT OF MY FARM! You're never coming back ever again you dirty ole' rodeo trash.

Bop?

You should've let me explain, Boyfriend.


// CORN THEFT //


\[Bambi gets a phone call from Dave.\]

HELLO?!?!

Hey Bambi, it's Dave. Are you ready for that picnic?

WHAT, NO! I'm in the middle of something! There's these two trespassers trying to steal MY corn!

By any chance, are these "Trespassers" you're harrassing an equally short couple?

Yes... Justifiably!

(I didn't think they would show up early...)

Bambi. They aren't trespassers. I know them.

Whaddyumean?

I told you this morning, I was planning on inviting a few people to the picnic. They're the "Guests" I was talking about!

That doesn't make sense...

Huh? What do you... Did you think I was gonna have a picnic with just you? That's weird.

Wait... AHA! I think I know what's going on here!

These aren't the friends you thought they were, Dave!

You've got to be kidding me Bambi-

\[Bambi abruptly hangs up on Dave.\]

Now I know what's really going on here...

You two are using Dave's "invite" as an EXCUSE to steal my corn!

Are you dense?

What?

You heard me, are you dense?

How am I dense?

How could you even assume we're here to steal your corn?

Who the hell does that?

People steal my corn all the time!

I mean, okay, so that means you can share an instance of that happening?

I don't have to give you any of my instances!

Do you have any instance or not, little man.

Little man? What do you mean little man-

Okay, I'm done. Make him shut up, babe.

Beep.



// MAZE //


My phone...

Look what you two did!

You don't know what you guys just got me into!!

What?

You both are gonna die!

Boop!

That's it.. That is it!

One more song... If you win, I-I, uhh..

I think I'm gonna go to bed after this..

Aww, you got tired from that temper tantrum, huh? Wanna blankie?

OH MY GOD STOP.



// MAZE END //


Fine... You win..

Yeah!

Just, go away! Please.

Dave finally arrives at Bambi's Farm.

Oh shit!

Hey, I'm here. Sorry, I was running late.

Tristan was a pain to get up. He was like "But Dad.." this, "But Dad.." that.

Don't talk about me like I'm not here!

You have a son? How adorable!

Oh yeah, and he's a great kid! Isn't that right, bud?



Dave, these trespassers ruined my day! Can you please get them out of here!

Are you serious, Bambi? They're my friends! Picnic, remember?

Wait...

...

Yeah, sorry about Bambi's behavior, guys. He tends to get a bit defensive when you step onto his property...

Hah, we're well aware.

Skedoo bop.

Oh. Ohhh, ohhhhhh!

SO I GOT ANGRY AND BROKE MY PHONE OVER NOTHING?

I'M SO STUPID! ...And just a little sorry.

It's okay Bambi, everyone makes mistakes from time to time!

Even very stupid ones that could've easily been averted.

I see straight through your sarcasm!

Alright everyone, how about we get this picnic started!

Oh heck yeah, food!

Beep!

\[Everyone eventually settles down and has a nice picnic together.\]



// SPLITATHON //


\[We continue with the group sitting outside and socializing.\]

Hey, uhh, Boyfriend is it?

Bo?

I feel like we never really settled it, the last time we fought...

Bop?

...Settled on who is better at singing, that is!

Boh.

Oh, you two wanna battle right now? I can get some stuff together real quick, then!

Perfect! Oh, and while we're at it...

I want you to put on the longest instrumental you have!

Damn, really?... Well, the best I can do is ten minutes!

Well, well! How's about a ten minute showdown, BF?

Yeah!

Whoever outlasts the other will be proven the better singer.

Hey... What about me? I did the singy thing.

=Oh, No thanks, Bambi. This is between me and him!

... Fine!

\[Bambi grumbles, but sits down and spectates.\]

Alright, I hope you're ready, because I'm not going down without a fight!

Beep bo bop!


// SPLITATHON END //


Wow, that was great! Good job, BF!

Beep!

Same to you Bambi!

Huh, who?

I was a little annoyed you butted in, but you did great!

Oh... well NEVER underestimate me!

Heh, I think that settles it, though. It's getting real late, so we gotta get ourselves back home.

Oh yeah, I think we should get going too.

Beep.

It was nice seeing you two. Call me if you ever wanna hang out again!

Yeah!

See ya, Dave!

\[BF and GF head back home.\]

Ah.. That was fun.

Your kid is dead, Dave.

He's asleep, don't say that!

Eh. Why did you bring Tristan anyways?

I just wanted to get him out of the house, but it looks like he's been out for a little too long.

I think he's dead.

He's not dead.
