corn_theft_4==WHAT, NO! I'm in the middle of something! There's these two trespassers trying to steal MY corn!
corn_theft_5==By any chance, are these "Trespassers" you're harrassing an equally short couple?
corn_theft_6==Yes... Justifiably!
corn_theft_7==(I didn't think they would show up early...)
corn_theft_8==Bambi. They aren't trespassers. I know them.
corn_theft_9==Whaddyumean?
corn_theft_10==I told you this morning, I was planning on inviting a few people to the picnic. They're the "Guests" I was talking about!
corn_theft_11==That doesn't make sense...
corn_theft_12==Huh? What do you... Did you think I was gonna have a picnic with just you? That's weird.
corn_theft_13==Wait... AHA! I think I know what's going on here!
corn_theft_14==These aren't the friends you thought they were, Dave!
corn_theft_15==You've got to be kidding me Bambi-
corn_theft_16==[Bambi abruptly hangs up on Dave.]
corn_theft_17==Now I know what's really going on here...
corn_theft_18==You two are using Dave's "invite" as an EXCUSE to steal my corn!
corn_theft_19==Are you dense?
corn_theft_20==What?
corn_theft_21==You heard me, are you dense?
corn_theft_22==How am I dense?
corn_theft_23==How could you even assume we're here to steal your corn?
corn_theft_24==Who the hell does that?
corn_theft_25==People steal my corn all the time!
corn_theft_26==I mean, okay, so that means you can share an instance of that happening?
corn_theft_27==I don't have to give you any of my instances!
corn_theft_28==Do you have any instance or not, little man.

splitathon_15==Hey... What about me? I did the singy thing.
splitathon_16==Oh, No thanks, Bambi. This is between me and him!
